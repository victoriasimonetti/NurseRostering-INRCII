# NurseRostering-INRCII
This repository contains the solutions for the problem presented in the Second International Nurse Rostering Competition (INRC-II).

The solutions were organized in different folders described below:

- "RP1", "RP2," and "RP3" have the files solutions for the three different relaxations of the NRP.
- "M1", "M2," and "M3" have the files solutions for the three different models. 
- "LAFO" has the files solutions for the Late Acceptance Fix-and-Optimize approach. For each instance, the ten runs are compiled in a single file.
